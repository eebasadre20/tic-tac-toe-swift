Aside from writing Hello, World! for your first program, building  your first game will always be the TIC-TAC-TOE game ( not really but mostly ). So, this is my first game in Swift programming language as I'm thinking to build a skill in mobile development. 

There will be more noob application that I'll be writing in Swift. Check out! lol :)
